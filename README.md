This is an android application built using native Java with the Android SDK. The purpose of this project was to better grasp the concepts of android development.
The app uses a database to store the activities you have during the day. You can add, edit or delete activties and also set up alarms for the activities.

Features to be added
- Ability to choose which day you want to check out.
- Ability to set up alarms for the activities in a day automatically. The idea is to wake the processor at 12 am and set up the alarms for the day using 
  AlarmManager and BroadcastReceriver.
